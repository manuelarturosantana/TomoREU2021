% The code focus on analyzing the difference between adding random and constant 
% perturbations to the Rguess.

% Let's set up a test problem that has "true" R values slightly 
% perturbed from our constant guess for R. Some comments about the 
% first few lines:
%  m               = number of times R changes 
%                   (in PRtomo_var this is also called m, and is the length 
%                    of vector R, or number of columns in the array angles)
%  Rguess          = guess that R is always equal to this value for all angles
%  Rtrue           = true values of R, which may be slight perturbations of Rguess
%  Rnoise          = scalar constant on the amount of perturbation added to Rguess
%  ang_noise       = scalar constant on the amount of perturbation added to
%                    ang_true
%  ang_guess       = The guess of what the projection angles are.
%  angles_true     = true projection angles, a slight perturpation of
%                    ang_guess. For this case, we will set angles_true
%                    equals to ang_guess as we want to focus on analyzing
%                    the difference between adding random or constant
%                    perturbations into the R values
%  p               = [total number of projection angles]/m, should be an 
%                    integer (see also PRtomo_var, where p is the number of
%                    rows in the array angles)
%  span            = scalar that determines the angular span of the rays, in 
%                    degrees. I think this should be constant, even if the
%                    the source moves (and hence the geometry parameters
%                    change). We will make this constant based on the 
%                    maximum value of Rtrue.

n               = 64;
m               = 4;   
Rnoise          = 0.5;
Rguess          = 2;

random = false;
if random
    Rtrue       = Rguess*ones(1,m) + Rnoise*(rand(1,m) - 0.5);
else % Add constant noise of Rnoise*0.5 (0.25 in this case) to R
    Rnoise_new  = Rnoise * 0.5;
    Rtrue       = Rguess*ones(1,m) + Rnoise_new*ones(1,m);
end

angles_guess    = (0:2:358);
p               = length(angles_guess)/m; 
span            = 2*atand(1/(2*max(Rtrue)-1));
ProbOptions     = PRset('CTtype', 'fancurved', 'span', span);
                          
% Check to make sure p = is an integer  
if p ~= fix(p)
    error('p = Nangles/m needs to be an integer')
end
%
% if p is an integer, reshape true and guess vector angles into an array 
% with p rows and m columns, each column corresponds to an entry in vector 
% R. Additionally add the noise to each column of the true angles.
% Since we only want to analyze the effect of having random or constant
% perturbations on R, we will set guessed and true angles equal

angles_true = angles_guess;
angles_true  = reshape(angles_true, p, m);
angles_guess = reshape(angles_guess,p,m);

[Atrue, btrue, xtrue, ProbInfo] = PRtomo_var(n, Rtrue, angles_true, ProbOptions);
b = PRnoise(btrue);

%
% Now setup a similar problem, using the guess for R and true angles
% (note that using PRtomo_var with a scalar input for R and corresponding
% vector for angles, should produce the same as calling PRtomo)
%
[A, ~, ~, ~] = PRtomo_var(n, Rguess, angles_true(:), ProbOptions);

%
% Now solve using IRhybrid_lsqr to see the difference in solutions
% using the true A and the guess for A
%
[x1, info1] = IRhybrid_lsqr(Atrue, b);
[x2, info2] = IRhybrid_lsqr(A, b);
